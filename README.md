# 🎨 Etch-a-Sketch

A simple browser-based **Etch-a-Sketch** project built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It lets you draw pixel-art style trails on a resizable grid. Inspired by the classic toy and created as a practice project.

## 🚀 Live Demo
👉 [Try it here](https://debopri-yo.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/)

## ✨ Features
- **16×16 grid** by default (256 squares).
- Hover over squares to **draw** — each square changes to a random color.
- **Resize the grid** with the button:  
  - Enter a number (1–100) for rows/columns.  
  - The grid adjusts automatically to stay within a 960×960px area.
- Fully responsive with **Flexbox layout**.
- Simple UI with a clear drawing area.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – structure  
- **CSS3 (Flexbox)** – grid layout and styling  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – dynamic grid creation and interactivity

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Progressive darkening effect (each hover darkens the square by 10%).  
- Different drawing modes: black pen, rainbow, eraser.  
- Clear button to reset the board.
